#algorithm_3_insertion_sort

This algorithm implements the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. 
It iterates through the array, each time picking an element and inserting it into its correct position
within the already sorted portion of the array, resulting in a sorted array at the end.
